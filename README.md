# Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health

## Overview
This project explores how remote work impacts mental health by analyzing a dataset with over 10,000 records. Key factors examined include stress levels, work-life balance, and productivity. The analysis was conducted entirely using Microsoft Excel, leveraging descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and visualizations to derive actionable insights.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the correlation between remote work and stress levels.
- Analyze work-life balance and its relationship with productivity.
- Identify actionable recommendations for organizations to improve remote work environments.

---

## Tools and Techniques
- **Microsoft Excel:**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Statistical analysis (e.g., Chi-Square, ANOVA).
  - Data visualization (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots).

- **Techniques Applied:**
  - Descriptive statistics for univariate analysis.
  - Outlier detection and data cleaning.
  - Hypothesis testing for relationships among variables.

---

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed invalid and missing values.
   - Identified and addressed outliers to ensure data integrity.

2. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Analyzed distributions of key variables like stress levels, hours worked, and mental health resources.
   - Created visualizations to represent data trends effectively.

3. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Conducted Chi-Square and ANOVA tests to examine relationships between work hours, stress levels, and access to mental health resources.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Developed clear and actionable visualizations, including bar charts and scatter plots, to communicate insights.

---

## Key Findings
- **Stress Levels:** Employees with limited access to mental health resources reported significantly higher stress levels.
- **Work-Life Balance:** Flexible work hours positively impacted work-life balance and overall satisfaction.
- **Productivity:** A strong correlation was observed between mental health resources and productivity metrics.

---

## Recommendations
- Provide accessible mental health resources to employees.
- Encourage flexible scheduling to improve work-life balance.
- Conduct periodic surveys to monitor employee stress levels.

---

## Future Scope
- Extend the analysis by incorporating additional demographic data for deeper insights.
- Utilize advanced tools like Power BI or Tableau for enhanced visualizations.
- Explore predictive modeling techniques for stress level forecasting.
